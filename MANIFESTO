 = KTurtle MANIFESTO =

KTurtle is an educational programming environment that aims to make programming as easy and touchable as possible.


 == Why not use an existing programming language to teach? ==

Specific features:
 * highlighting during execution (shows where the executer is executing)
 * highlighting of errors
 * integrated error messages and help
 * fully translatable (the programming language itself, the examples, the error messages, the GUI, the manual... everything)
 * yet still RealCoding(tm), no clicky clicky stuff
 * and everything in one program (instead of separate: debugger, documentation, IDE, interpreter, etc.)
