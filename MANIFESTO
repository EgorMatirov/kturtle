 = KTurtle MANIFESTO =

KTurtle is an educatinal programming environment that aims to make programming as easy and touchable as possible.


 == Why not use an existing programming language to teach? ==

Specific features:
 * highlighting during execution (shows where the executer is executing)
 * highlighting of errors
 * all tools are easily available in the environment
 * intergrated error messages and help
 * fully translatable (language itself, error messages, GUI, manual... everything)
 * yet still RealCoding(tm), no clicky clicky stuff
