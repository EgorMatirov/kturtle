How to translate the logo keywords (commands)

The commands files are located in kdeedu/kturtle/src/data/keywords/
Each file is named
logokeywords.code.xml
where code is the iso code for your country (note that this must be a valid iso code).

1) Copy the logokeywords.en_US.xml file by renaming it to logokeywords.code.xml where code is your country code (2 or 4 letters ISO code)

2) Translate in your own language the content of the <keyword> tag i.e the information between <keyword> and </keyword> whenever it's possible and the content of the <alias> tag, i.e the information between the <alias> and </alias>. These contents are related as the alias is a shortcut for the keyword.

For example translate 'while' in: <keyword>while</keyword>.

Please don't translate anything else and don't translate English words in <command name="english_word">. These must stay in English.

3) Save your file as utf-8 (in Kate, use Save As and change to utf8 in the box on the right of the file name)

4) Commit your file or send it to Anne-Marie.

5) In case of any doubt, please contact Anne-Marie Mahfouf, annemarie.mahfouf@free.fr for more information.

Thanks for your work.
