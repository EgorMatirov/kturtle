How to translate the syntax highlighting files

The syntax highlighting files are located in kdeedu/kturtle/src/data/highlightstyles/
Each file is named
logohighlightstyle.code.xml
where code is the iso code for your country (note that this must be a valid iso code).
Please note that the country code must be the same here than in the logokeywords file and for the example folder.

1) Copy the logohighlightstyle.en_US.xml file by renaming it to logohighlightstyle.code.xml where code is your country code (2 or 4 letters ISO code)

2) Line 4 of the file, there is
<language name="en_US" 
change en_US with your language ISO code (2 or 4 letters).

3) Set the encoding in your editor to utf-8 and ranslate in your own language the content of the <item> tag i.e the information between <item> and </item>. This content must match the logokeyword file.

For example translate 'while' in: <item> while </item> and leave the spaces as they are (one at the beginning and one at the end).

Please don't translate anything else.

4) Save your file as utf-8 (in Kate, use Save As and change to utf8 in the box on the right of the file name)

5) Commit your file (add your filename in the Makefile.am) or send it to Anne-Marie.

6) In case of any doubt, please contact Anne-Marie Mahfouf, annemarie.mahfouf@free.fr for more information.

Thanks for your work.
