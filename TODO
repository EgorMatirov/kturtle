 == mainwindow ==
 * make a docked window for inspecting the variables (and the state of the canvas), and a AST view widget
 ---
 * commandline flag for parsing an en_US script into c++ example code (bunch of strings)
 * make settings menu (or not: maybe keep all in other menu's) [fonttype, fontsize, language, default canvas size]
 * make fullscreen mode (hide all GUI elemets but the canvas during execution)
 * connect statusTips and whatIsThis
 * get WhatIsThis (et al) help in
 * do reordering (in stead of duping) when adding already existing recent file items


 == interpreter ==
 * make sure recursion over several functions is possible (index learns at execution init time)
 * ruby managed unittest suite using the echoer (make the echoer more clever --> maybe put into the executer)
 ---
 * verbosity/debugmsg levels
 * investivate the efficiency of the echoer
      --> maybe hook feedback mechanism directly on the executer / the parser's AST
 * make more unittests (redesign the unittest framework using the to-be-created commandline invoke method)
 * finish all functions
 * finish and test function learning system


 == canvas ==
 * f**king scrollbars!
 * resizing of the canvas doesn't resize the actual canvas frame widget
 ---
 * context menu for save and print
 * add wrapping functionality
 * make state of all things available to the executer


 == editor ==
 * connect editor to context help (F2) action
 ---
 * fill tools menu
 * connect the editor to some statusbar fields
 * reimplement context menu for cut/copy/paste, undo/redo, show/hide, and context help
 * make a syntax highlighting nicer (more style categories)
 * some html export function (just use the toHtml() method)


 == PR ==
 * update the e.k.o/kturtle website with some news items and some text
 * funk up the project page
 ---
 * make wikipedia page nicer (screenshots, etc.)
 * realease a pre-release
 * maybe: team up with kdelibs-windows team for an early windows version
 * a wiki for childrens and teachers manual + translations + translators info [or docbook; KDE translated]













 == maybe someday's ==
 * refactor the generators ruby code
 * totally hide the implementation of the editor class (use proxies for signal/slots)
