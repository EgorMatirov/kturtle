How to translate examples

1) Create a folder with your language iso as name
2) Copy the english example in this folder and rename the files with your language translation. This will allow users to easily and quickly understand what the example is about.
3) See in kturtle/src/data/keywords/ the file corresponding to your language. This file must be done before translating the examples. 
Replace in the example files all English keywords with your translated keywords.
4) Commit your folder or send it to Anne-Marie.
5) In case of any doubt, please contact Anne-Marie Mahfouf, annemarie.mahfouf@free.fr for more information.
6) Finally, if you want, you can add your own examples in this folder.

Thanks for your work.
