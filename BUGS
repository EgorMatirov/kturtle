 = canvas (QGraphicView) =
# scrollbars
i simply want the canvas to be its default size, in the center of the mainwindow; unit the mainwindow is too small for the canvas be fully shown, then it should have scrollbars.
right now it _always_ has scrollbars; which is plain ugly. and i have try for many hours to solve it, but didn't manage.

# printing: no textcolor, make font larger by default, decided where to print the text in relation to the turtle (centered?)


 = mainwindow (KXmlGuiWindow) =
# no known bugs


 = editor (QTextEdit) =
# floating bug
If you pull the editor out of kturtle and resize it, then close kturtle, on subsequent executions the editor window will not paint itself and will be basically unusable.  It is possible but not easy to get it back into the window and make it usable again for future executions


 = interpreter =
# doesn't handle recursion very well right now

 
 = inspector =
# no known bugs
