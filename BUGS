 = canvas (QGraphicView) =
# scrollbars
i simply want the canvas to be its default size, in the center of the mainwindow; unit the mainwindow is too small for the canvas be fully shown, then it should have scrollbars.
right now it _always_ has scrollbars; which is plain ugly. and i have try for many hours to solve it, but didn't manage.

# printing: no textcolor, can't print numbers, make font larger by default, decided where to print the text in relation to the turtle (centered?)


 = mainwindow (KMainWindow) =
# no known bugs


 = editor (QTextEdit) =
# highlighting a word or an error that has a soft break in it (like "wewerewrrohroewnrewonreoiewnrioewnroewnrewiowenrioewnr" on a small viewport) is highlighted wrongly, see the editor.h code for the TODO's.



 = interpreter =
# "a = 0" crashes the parser (should be "$a = 0", or "a 0")
