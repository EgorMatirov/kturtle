 = canvas (QGraphicView) =
# scrollbars
i simply want the canvas to be its default size, in the center of the mainwindow; unit the mainwindow is too small for the canvas be fully shown, then it should have scrollbars.
right now it _always_ has scrollbars; which is plain ugly. and i have try for many hours to solve it, but didn't manage.




 = mainwindow (KMainWindow) =
# the toolbar has no handle...
...and i cant set one. probably because of the LocalToolBar subclassing




 = editor (QTextEdit) =
# no known bugs.



 = interpreter =
# some examples crash
